# Gaming Programming II

This is a collection of programs that I made throughout the school year in Gaming Programming II, it is all written in Java using processing and includes a variety of programs.

Most of the programs are interactive media such as games or artwork, however there is an amount of programs designed to aid me and my peers in the creation of said media.

Some of these programs include:

- An interactive map maker that turns a 2d grid of squares into a 2 Dimensional Integer Array 
- A weighted random number generator for picking letters in the alphabet (For use in word games)
- An initials entering program for use with a leaderboard system (For use with an Arcade Cabinet)
- A leaderboard system that saves scores and initials into a JSON and sorts it based on score (For use with an Arcade Cabinet)
